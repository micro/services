Islamic prayer times

# Prayer Service

Prayer (salah) times for the religion of Islam. The daily obligatory prayers collectively form the second of the five pillars 
in Islam, observed five times every day at prescribed times. These are Fajr (observed at dawn), Zuhr prayer (observed at noon), Asr (observed late 
in the afternoon), Maghrib (observed at dusk), and Isha (observed after sunset).
