# Sunnah Service

Sunnah are the traditions and practices of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, that constitute a model for Muslims to follow. 
According to classical Islamic theories, the sunnah are documented by hadith (the verbally transmitted record of the teachings, 
deeds and sayings, silent permissions or disapprovals of Muhammad), and along with the Quran (the book of Islam), are the divine 
revelation (Wahy) delivered through Muhammad that make up the primary sources of Islamic law and belief/theology.
