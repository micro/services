# [service].proto and examples.json are the only files that affect how the m3o clients generator

# internally is not a concern and will not affect how internally m3o clients work.
# Also, take under consideration this note https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#git-diff-comparisons
